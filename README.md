# Welcome to Course Builder

Course builder allows you to create a course that you can then publish on the platform.

Each course contains lessons, and lessons can be edited with a built in content editor, you also have the possibility to embed images, video (using a url) and even Google slide or sheets.

When a course is published, the free courses can be viewed by unlogged user, and premium courses can be viewed by logged in users.
